### Proxy Pattern

- Provide a placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- Remote Proxy: Manages interaction between a client and remote object.
- Virtual Proxy: Control access to an object that is expensive to instantiate.
- Protection Proxy: Control access to methods of an object based on the caller.
