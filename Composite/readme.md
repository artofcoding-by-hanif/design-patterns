### Composite Pattern

- The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
- This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 
- It is particularly useful when dealing with tree structures, such as file systems, organizational hierarchies, or graphical user interfaces.
