### Memento Pattern

- The Memento design pattern is a behavioral design pattern used in object-oriented programming. 
- Its main purpose is to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later, without violating encapsulation. 
- This pattern is especially useful when you need to implement undo or rollback functionality.
