### Strategy Pattern

- The Strategy Design Principle, often referred to simply as the Strategy Pattern, is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. 
- This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
- Strategy allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
