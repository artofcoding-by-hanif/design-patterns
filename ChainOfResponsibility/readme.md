### Chain or Responsibility Pattern

- The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled. 
- This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without the sender needing to know which object will ultimately process it.
